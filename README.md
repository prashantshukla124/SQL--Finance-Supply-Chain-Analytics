# SQL--Finance-Supply-Chain-Analytics

AtliQ Hardwares: Finance and Supply Chain Analytics Project Using SQL

This repository presents a comprehensive SQL-based analytics project focused on the Finance and Supply Chain domains of AtliQ Hardwares. It was developed as part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp conducted by Codebasics and demonstrates the application of SQL for deriving actionable business insights.

Project Overview

AtliQ Hardwares is a multinational organization specializing in computer hardware, including PCs, printers, and accessories. The project utilizes structured datasets that encapsulate key business operations, such as sales performance, customer segmentation, and regional distribution metrics.

Objective

The primary goal of this initiative is to analyze transactional data using MySQL to extract meaningful insights that can inform strategic decisions. The project explores customer trends, sales patterns, and supply chain efficiency across various regions and product categories.

Business Context

Due to limitations encountered in traditional spreadsheet tools—primarily file size and performance constraints—AtliQ Hardwares initiated a transition to a database-driven approach. By leveraging MySQL, the organization aims to overcome operational inefficiencies and enable its analytics team to perform more scalable and reliable data analysis.

Key Findings

1. Amazon emerged as the top-performing customer with net sales of $109.03M in FY 2021, followed by AtliQ Exclusive at $79.92M.


2. India led all markets with $210.67M in net sales during the same period, with the USA ranking second at $132.05M.


3. Amazon alone contributed 13.23% of the company’s total net sales in FY 2021.


4. In the APAC region, Amazon held the highest market share, generating 12.99% of the total regional net sales.


5. India ranked first in the APAC region in terms of gross sales performance.


Skills Acquired

1. Designing and implementing user-defined functions to enhance query logic and reusability.


2. Utilizing database views for simplified data access and abstraction.


3. Developing and executing stored procedures for efficient, repeatable workflows.


4. Applying advanced window functions such as OVER, ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK for analytical tasks.


5. Creating and managing temporary tables for intermediate data storage and manipulation.


6. Gaining practical knowledge of indexing strategies and database schema creation and maintenance.


7. Ensuring data consistency through integrity constraints and entity-relationship modeling.


8. Working with diverse data types, including numeric, textual, date/time, JSON, and spatial formats.


9. Understanding the role of primary and foreign keys in maintaining relational integrity.


10. Executing fundamental data operations such as insertion, updating, and deletion.
